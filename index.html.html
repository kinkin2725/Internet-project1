	GenAI tools is able to provide learners with access to a vrious amount of information from different sources by searching and retrieving from relevant content, academic papers, articles, and research studies, enabling learners in a short period of time to explore a wide range of topics and deepen their understanding.
	<LI> <A HREF="https://lsa.umich.edu/sweetland/instructors/guides-to-teaching-writing/genai-in-the-writing-process.html"><B> Writing Assistance </B></A> <BR></LI>
	GenAI tools can offer valuable writing support. They can help learners improve their writing skills by providing grammar and spelling checks, suggesting alternative sentence structures, and offering vocabulary enhancements. This can lead to clearer and more effective communication in academic writing.

	 GenAI tools can facilitate continuous professional development for educators. These tools can provide resources, training modules, and feedback to help educators improve their teaching practices. By leveraging GenAI tools, educators can stay up-to-date with the latest pedagogical approaches, instructional methods, and educational research, ensuring their teaching remains relevant and effective.
	<LI> <B> Improved Access to Education </B> <BR></LI> 
	GenAI tools can help bridge the gap in access to education through providing learning opportunities to individuals who may face geographical, financial, or other barriers. Learners can access educational resources, online courses, and tutoring services from anywhere, enabling lifelong learning and facilitating education for all.

	<LI> <B> Data Privacy and Confidentiality </B> <BR></LI>
	This is largely uncharted territory. As genAI is increasingly integrated and embedded into vendor supplied tools and platforms, institutions of higher education must assess how these tools handle sensitive and confidential data, including those protected by FERPA, and whether these data could inadvertently, or due to malicious intent, become public and or be used in decision-making where previous use was not allowed. Even trends based on access to specific types of data could prove to be harmful. The overall area of data integrity is one that warrants significant thought, consideration and monitoring, as well as heightened assessment from ethical, legal and humanistic perspectives.
	<LI> <B> Intellectual Property and Copyright Infringement </B> <BR></LI>
	Since genAI tools learn through exposure to vast troves of data and information, an increasingly important question is whether their product, gleaned from previous art, infringes copyright or intellectual property rights. While recent focus has been on visual art, the same concerns apply to intellectual property based on the product of research and scholarship including that of course materials. From the perspective of teaching and faculty effort, these issues take on special and critical significance that should not be minimized.

	The PolyU generative AI application is solely for PolyU staff and students to use for teaching and learning, research, and work-related activities only. Gen AI tools cover GPT-3.5, GPT-4, image-to-text using Azure Cognitive vision service and text-to-image using Stable Diffusion SDXL 1.0 model running on public Cloud as well as open-sourced model Tongyi Qianwen and MIxtral 8x7B hosted on University campus. Access requires successful authentication using your staff or student NetID.

	A higher education learner working on a research project for their biology class. They need to gather relevant information about a specific topic within the field of genetics. Instead of spending hours manually searching through numerous academic papers and databases, they can utilize GenAI tools to streamline the process.
